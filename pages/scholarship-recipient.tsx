              I am excited to announce that the first child TeeTag is helping
              raise money for is a girl named Vera Duffy. Vera actually goes to
              my high school and she is a current sophomore. She recently lost
              her mother this past year to Breast Cancer. Vera has the most
              sweet and kind heart and I am blessed for the opportunity to help
              her :) The goal is to raise $5000 through TeeTag which will then
              be allocated and distributed to Vera's education future through a
              local non-for-profit I am partnered with. Below is Vera's personal
              story and more about who she is...

                My name is Vera Duffy and I am 16 years old. I was born in
                Russia. I do not remember anything about my biological family.
                When I was three, my sisters and I came to the United States and
                was adopted by a wonderful family -- a caring father and loving,
                trusting, supportive mom.
              </p>
              <p className="mt-16 h8">
                My mom, Karen, was my guidepost for every decision I made. She
                filled our house with friends, love, arts, and books. Thanks to
                her I have a passion in my life -- horseback riding. While I
                ride the whole world disappears. I feel wind in my hair, and
                freedom in my heart. I have no worries, and my spirits soar.
                Every so often, my mom would come and watch me ride, always
                supporting me.

                Unfortunately, last Thanksgiving my mom passed away due to
                complications from breast cancer. This was the greatest loss of
                my 16 years. My lifeline was irreparably severed or so I
                thought. But my mom lives on through my memories, her enduring
                love, and the many interests she inspired in me. She is with me
                when I ride, or when I look at a particularly vibrant, colorful
                painting. When I encounter a difficult decision I look inside
                myself and ask what would my mom do and without fail I hear her
                voice telling me, guiding me, and gently encouraging me to do
                the right thing.

              My mom's biggest legacy is her courage. Courage to experience the
              world and beyond, courage to try new things just because they are
              unknown, and courage to accept anyone and everyone for their
              differences and unique points of view. I hope to become a person
              my mom is proud of, a person full of loyalty, tolerance, and
              courage.
